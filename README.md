# Requirements Analyst Agent – Assignment 2

## 1. Executive Summary
This project implements an **AI-powered Requirements Analyst Agent** that analyzes e-commerce user stories and automatically extracts **testable, structured requirements**.

The agent is built using the **CrewAI framework** and leverages a **Large Language Model (LLM)** to perform natural language understanding, requirement classification, edge-case identification, and gap analysis.

This agent serves as the foundation for a future **multi-agent system**, where its structured JSON output can be consumed by downstream agents such as a Test Case Designer (Assignment 1B).

---

## 2. Project Objectives
- Analyze natural language e-commerce user stories
- Extract **functional** and **non-functional** requirements
- Identify **edge cases and boundary conditions**
- Detect **gaps, ambiguities, and missing requirements**
- Generate **structured JSON output** suitable for automation
- Ensure **schema compliance and testability**
- Provide a clean, extensible agent design

---

## 3. Framework Usage (Critical Requirement)
This solution is implemented using the **CrewAI framework**, satisfying the mandatory AI framework requirement.

### AI Components Used
- **Framework:** CrewAI
- **Agent:** Requirements Analyst Agent
- **Task:** Requirement Extraction Task
- **LLM:** Groq-hosted LLaMA 3 model
- **Orchestration:** Single-agent Crew execution

✅ No rule-based or keyword-matching logic is used  
✅ All outputs are dynamically generated by the LLM

---

## 4. Agent Specification

### Role
**Senior Business Analyst with E-commerce Domain Expertise**

### Responsibilities
- Interpret user stories and acceptance criteria
- Extract functional requirements suitable for testing
- Identify non-functional requirements (performance, usability, reliability)
- Discover edge cases and boundary conditions
- Flag ambiguous or missing requirements
- Assign priority and categories
- Produce structured, machine-readable output

## 7. Input Scenario
The agent is validated using the following e-commerce user story:

**User Story**
> As a customer, I want to add products to my shopping cart and modify quantities, so that I can purchase multiple items in a single order.

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Add products to cart
- Update quantities
- Remove items
- Display total price including tax
- Persist cart during session
- Enforce maximum quantity limits
- Prevent out-of-stock items
- Show availability status
- Provide user confirmations

---

## 8. Output Format
The agent outputs **strictly valid JSON** with the following structure:
- Functional requirements
- Non-functional requirements
- Edge cases
- Gaps identified

Example output file:
```
output/sample_output.json
```

---

## 9. How to Run

### 1. Install dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
### 2. Configure environment variables
This project uses an LLM and requires an API key.
Create a .env file in the project root and add:
```
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
```
This key is used by CrewAI to connect to the LLM.



### 3. Execute the Requirements Analyst Agent
---

Run the following command from the project root:
```
python main.py

```

### 4. View the generated output
---

After successful execution, the structured requirements output will be generated at:
```
output/sample_output.json

```



## 10. Validation & Error Handling
---

- Ensures valid JSON output
- Enforces schema compliance
- Handles malformed or incomplete inputs gracefully
- Uses CrewAI task constraints to prevent free-form output

## 11. Preparation for Assignment 1B
---
The agent is designed to:
- Produce structured, machine-readable output
- Maintain consistent IDs and categorization
- Support downstream agents (e.g., Test Case Generator)
- Enable traceability between requirements and test cases

## 12. Known Limitations & Future Enhancements
---
- Currently supports single-agent execution
- Can be extended to multi-agent collaboration
- Future enhancements may include:
- Traceability matrix generation
- Natural language querying of requirements
- Multi-format input support
